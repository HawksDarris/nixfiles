# Plan
1. Set up wallpaper picker
2. Maybe some way to change between themes
3. add pacman chasing ghosts maybe 
  - to kitty not to nu (otherwise it shows up in tty)
4. change vim autocmd for compiler
   
# TODO 
- Figure out how to make pandoc use local revealjs instead of going to unpkg.com.
- Set nixvim to persist cursor location on close
- Set nixvim to persist undo on close
